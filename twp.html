          <h1>The Wander Project</h1>
          <br><p>The Wander Project wants to <b>change how you make itineraries</b> with a responsive website with mobile application capabilities that allows users to use social media as inspiration.</p>
          <br><p>Whether it’s wanderlusting, planning a business trip, a staycation, or a trip abroad, <b>there are different circumstances for each trip,</b> but no matter what stage of planning you’re at, the Wander Project <b>has everything you need to make it your best trip ever!</b> As an avid adventurer, I was happy to help with the design and development process.</p>

          <h2>Proposal</h2>
          <p>I was brought on to help design a <b>new application for Cloud storage</b> and organization and to be able to <b>combine it with collaboration.</b> The application had to be <b>able to save and organize content,</b> and be able to collaborate or social share.</p>
          <br><h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>I wanted to create an application that <b>makes trip planning easier.</b> Trip planning can be overwhelming, whether it’s for yourself, a business trip, or for a group of people.</p>
          <br><h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>I wanted to create an application that centralized everything from finding inspiration and doing research to finalizing a coherent itinerary.</p>

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <h5>User Survey</h5>
          <p>In order to better understand how people used cloud storage and planned their trips, I conducted an online survey to get a general consensus. I wanted to know:</p>
          <br><ul class="cs_list">
              <li><p>How often does the average person use cloud storage?</p></li>
              <li><p>What can be improved with current cloud storage apps?</p></li>
              <li><p>What is the average person’s trip planning process?</p></li>
              <li><p>What is the most frustrating thing about trip planning? </p></li>

          <br><br><p>After a couple of days of collecting results, I found that:</p>

              <p>use cloud storage at least 1-2 times a week (if not more).</p>

          <p>Based on the importance of the task, I created flow charts of the steps a user would have to take to achieve these tasks. While there are a lot of things that needed to be implemented, the top three user stories were for creating an account, organizing and adding media, most importantly, creating an itinerary.</p>

          <h5>Sitemap</h5>
          <p>With user stories and flows planned out, it was easy to stitch the pieces together with an overarching sitemap. This helped create content strategy, and provided a reference to look to when designing the screens.</p>

        <h5>Wireframing & Usability Testing</h5>
        <p>With the user flows planned out, I was able to start building the wireframe for the desktop website. I started ideating on paper, trying to get a general feel of what the website should look like, and to make sure all my frames checked off all the tasks of the flow chart.</p>

          <p>After that, it was easy to transfer my drawings onto Figma. With the basic structure of the website, sans design, color, font, or images, I was able to hash out the general flow of how I wanted things to go.</p>

          <h5>Logo</h5>
          <p>To create the logo, I started off with possible names by using <b>word play with travel-esque words.</b> I finally decided on The Wander Project, which to me <i>perfectly describes what making an itinerary is.</i> I sketched out icons that <b>portrayed travel or exploration,</b> such as airplanes, compasses, and maps. I decided on the compass because I liked the circular aspect of it and iterated logos playing around with the words and shape of the compass.</p>

          <h2>Prototypes & Testing</h2>
          <h5>Hi-Fidelity Prototypes</h5>
          <p>With a style guide established, I built the first working prototype. These are a few of my favorite pages: the landing page after you log-in, your itinerary with a map view, and your list of itineraries.</p>

          <h5>Preference Testing</h5>
          <p>But before I conducted another round of usability testing, I had a few issues with the design and was unsure if my design properly showcased what I wanted to convey. I conducted a series of preference testing that looked at everything from borders, spacing, colors, and alternating images. I wanted to make sure my design was not only aesthetically pleasing, but also functioned properly as well.</p>

          <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
          <p>After implementing the preferred stylizing, I conducted another round of usability testing which gave me really good feedback on small details that I needed to pay more attention to. Some key fixes that came out of usability testing included:</p>
            <br><ul class="cs_list">
                <li><p>Reads like a social feed; wanted to see more aspects of social media, such as liking, commenting, and seeing who posted it.</p></li>
                <li><p>Having “coming up” and “past” sections in the itineraries page for better organization.</p></li>
                <li><p>Being able to share itinerary with other users instead of only being able to collaborate.</p></li>
              </ul>
          <br><p>Otherwise, the general consensus was that they loved how easy it was to use and how aesthetically pleasing the mobile application was. With this feedback, I was able to address the issues I thought were most important and created my final prototype.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>I am really happy with the end prototype for this project, but also see areas which can be improved on. Although I have worked on concept projects before, this was the one where I <b>learned the importance of usability testing.</b> I knew what I wanted to convey to the user, but I didn’t realize that my intended designs can be conveyed differently by the potential audience; getting feedback from various people made my project stronger. I always knew what aspects I wanted to implement, but it’s the little things that I didn’t catch which makes usability testing so important.</p>
