          <br><h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>There needed to be a more <b>universal lifestyle tracker instead of having multiple trackers designed to help the user consistently track, without overflowing the user with notifications</b>. The app should <i>be clean and simple, yet motivating in a way to have it seamlessly integrated into their lifestyle.</i></p>
          <br><h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>The app should be <b>appeal to the user by motivating with color. As the user inputs more data, the more detailed and color-filled the app gets. The more progress the user sees, the more likely they are to keep good habits.</b> The user also gets a detailed insight of how their habits are for the day, week, month, and year.</p>

          <h2>Research: Understanding Tracking Habits</h2>
          <h5>User Survey</h5>
          <p>In order to better understand the behaviors of current trackers, as well as non-trackers, I conducted an online survey to get a general consensus of lifestyle tracking. I wanted to know:</p>
          <br><ul class="cs_list">
              <li><p>What kind of habits were people tracking?</p></li>
              <li><p>How are they tracking it?</p></li>
              <li><p>What can be improved in their current way of tracking?</p></li>
              <li><p>What are some reasons for non-trackers to not track?</p></li>
              <li><p>Would non-trackers be interested in tracking if they wanted to start a good habit or stop a bad habit?</p></li>
            </ul>
          <br><br><p>After a couple of days of collecting results, I found that:</p>
            <div class="stats_text">
              <div>
                <h1>56%</h1>
                <p>of people are currently tracking.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h1>88%</h1>
                <p>use some sort of mobile app and/or wearable device.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h1>58%</h1>
                <p>of mobile app trackers wished it was more interactive.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h1>Top 3</h1>
                <p>categories are: exercise, food/calorie intake, and mood.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h1>70%</h1>
                <p>of non-trackers found it to be too much work.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h1>80%</h1>
                <p>of non-trackers would be willing to try.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          <br><p>I also came across a response that really stood out to me:</p>
          <br><p class="quote"> “I wish there was a way I was able to actually keep a habit, not give up after a week. I have ADHD and think that makes it a lot harder, it <b>feels like most apps are made for very neurotypical people</b>.”</p>
          <br><p>So, I really wanted to make sure this app was interactive enough that it didn't become something users eventually forgot about.</p>

        <div class="research_b_text">
          <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
          <p>I also took a look at some existing lifestyle tracking apps such as Fitbit, Habitica, and Simple Habit Tracker. I wanted to see what worked with each one  and what I could do differently.</p>

          <p>Based on the importance of the task, I created flow charts of the steps a user would have to take to achieve these tasks.

          <h5>Logo</h5>
          <p>Since my concept relies heavily on color, I knew I had to lock down an aesthetically pleasing brand. I started off by choosing a name for the app, <b>ideating off words that centered around health, habits, and lifestyle.</b> I decided on <i>You in Review, which perfectly represents the data insights the app provides.</i></p>
          <br><p>To further tie in the brand to the logo, I incorporated an element directly from the app itself, and used that to create a make-shift circular border around the word “You”.</p>

I also needed a main color that kept the whole thing together, so I decided on choosing <b>the golden yellow since it seemed warm and inviting.</b> With these colors in mind, it was easy to incorporate them in the logo.</p>

          <h5>Style Guide</h5>
          <p>After finalizing a logo and essentially a brand, I wanted to make sure everything was consistent with one another before “dressing up” the wireframe. Creating a style guide, or a set of standards allowed me to make sure I didn’t have slightly different variations of the same color, or font that kept on changing as you used the app. </p>

              <p>In order to motivate and engage the user to consistently track and use the app without overflowing the user with notifications, I decided to use color as a motivator. As the user inputs more data, the more detailed and color-filled the app gets. The more progress the user sees, the more likely they are to keep good habits.<p>

          <p>With my Style Guide established, I was able to incorporate it into my wireframe and make a working prototype. After finalizing those changes, I wanted to make sure the prototype would be usable without any kinks, so I conducted some usability tests.</p>

          <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
          <p>I ran tests by giving them instructions to complete the onboarding process, as well as navigate through the app to see goals and data. It was very interesting to see how different people perceived the design. Specifically between one who was more creative, and another who was more logical. It really put my design and intentions into perspective, and how I could tweak a few things to make sure I got my point across.</p>
          <br><p>I made a list of tasks for them to accomplish:</p>
          <br><ul class="cs_list">
            <li><p>Begin and finish the onboarding process as if you were a new user.</p></li>
            <li><p>Complete morning check-in.</p></li>
            <li><p>Take a look at Today's Goals. What can you tell me about them?</p></li>
            <li><p>What can you tell me about Yesterday's goals?</p></li>
            <li><p>Navigate to the Data section and tell me how you're doing for this week's goals in the category for Food.</p></li>
            <li><p>What about for the month? And for the year?</p></li>

          <p>While the users can agree that the app is clean and aesthetically pleasing, there were some minor changes that needed to be made in order to make some buttons and its intended functions be more consistent and clear. Spacing issues was also a problem on some of the pages, where it was a little cluttered.</p>

          <p>While I am overall happy with the final prototype, usability testing also brought up some interesting concerns that I hadn’t thought of that I could address in future developments. <b>Although this app was intended to use color as a motivating factor, there is room to develop for colorblind people.</b></p>
          <br><p>It was also brought up that the year view in data analytics might set off trypophobia for some people, so I would need to address that as well. <i>Other minor developments would include smaller preference settings</i> such as choosing between 12 hours vs 24 hour time, integrating other motivating factors such as words of encouragement, and habit tools such as integrating hourly data inputs and water intake suggestions.</p>
