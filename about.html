          <h1>Hello!</h1>
          <br><h3>My name is Jessica Cheng, but you can call me Jess! I’m from the Bay Area, but currently living in Los Angeles.
          <br><br><b>I’ve always been the creative type.</b> I grew up in a traditional Chinese family setting. My father wanted me to follow in his footsteps and become a computer engineer. My summers were always spent in summer school (and not the fun kind)… but I always knew I’d end up a designer of some sort. Whenever there was a project due, I never missed the opportunity to take the creative route. Since I was being forced to be learning, I would always look for ways to entertain myself. As long as I was being creative, it never felt like work. My first job was in high school, teaching art to elementary and middle school students. I was able to sneak a creative outlet under the pretense of it being a source of income. Then come senior year, my parents pressured me apply to UCs or be a legacy at Utah State. That year, I won the annual logo contest for a local festival and I knew I’d be applying to art schools instead of looking to major in computer science.
          <br><br><b><i>“Every child is an artist, the problem is staying an artist when you grow up.”</i> - Pablo Picasso.</b> Art school was great. My parents figured I’d attend school for a year or two before transferring to a four-year college. That only made me work harder, and I graduated with a BFA in Product Design. I interned at Anthropologie as a window display designer. I spent another summer as an intern for a professor working on UI/UX design for a mobile application. I loved every minute of it, but for some reason I stayed working as a server after I graduated. I had an incredible amount of student debt, but the customer service industry paid me enough to be independent. I was living in the “real world” and I didn’t know how to put a creative spin on that. It wasn’t without a learning experience though. I worked hard and climbed my way to be Assistant Manager. And as I was training to become a Manager, life has a funny way of nudging you back on track. I fell asleep driving back to the Bay Area after a night shift, ran off the road, and crumpled my SUV into a Mini Cooper. Not only was that a wake up call (pun intended), it put my life into perspective.
          <br><br><b>Back to my roots.</b> I started working at Staging company. I was always intrigued by Interior Design, and HDTV is one of my favorite channels (after the Food Network). Finally, for the first time in a long time, I was excited to be at work. I got to use my creative side, while implementing customer service when working with real estate agents. I even got to pull out my management skills when I got promoted to Lead Designer. But something was still missing - although I loved my job, I wasn’t passionate about it. I wanted to design something that is lasting and concrete, and staging design was only tangible until the property is sold.
          <br><br><b>Everything happens for a reason.</b> I started looking into things that I was passionate about and it boiled down to graphic design and UI/UX design. Based off the few projects I worked on, I couldn’t help but feel UI/UX design was a field that resonated with me. You always hear the phrase “there’s an app for that” and I liked the idea of finding technological solutions to everyday problems. When I was studying product design, I was designing objects that solved problems. It only makes sense to continue my education to flow with the rise in technology. I started researching programs and I had a close friend whom was completing a bootcamp in New York. As she talked about it, I couldn’t help but be inspired; and isn’t that the ultimate goal though? Creativity has the ability to inspire, to influence, and make changes. With the ever growing innovations of technology, the possibilities are endless. I came across Bloc and a week later I was enrolled. With my apprenticeship ending soon, I am definitely excited for this career path. I guess in the end, I did follow in my father’s footsteps and chose a career in tech; I just decided to, like always, take the creative route.</h3>
